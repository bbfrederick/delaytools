^^^^^^^^^^

Description:
""""""""""""

The central program in this package is rapidtide2.  This is the program that quantifies the correlation strength and time delay of pervasive signals in a BOLD fMRI dataset.

At its core, rapidtide2 is simply performing a full crosscorrelation between a "probe" timecourse and every voxel in an fMRI dataset (by “full” I mean over a range of time lags that account for any delays between the signals, rather than only at zero lag, as in a Pearson correlation).  As with many things, however, the devil is in the details, and so rapidtide2 provides a number of features which make it pretty good at this particular task.  A few highlights:

* There are lots of ways to do something even as simple as a cross-correlation in a nonoptimal way (not windowing, improper normalization, doing it in the time rather than frequency domain, etc.).  I'm pretty sure what rapidtide2 does by default is, if not the best way, at least a very good and very fast way.
* rapidtide2 has been optimized and profiled to speed it up quite a bit; it has an optional dependency on numba – if it’s installed, some of the most heavily used routines will speed up significantly due to judicious use of @jit.
* The sample rate of your probe regressor and the fMRI data do not have to match - rapidtide2 resamples the probe regressor to an integral multiple of the fMRI data rate automatically.
* The probe and data can be temporally prefiltered to the LFO, respiratory, or cardiac frequency band with a command line switch, or you can specify any low, high, or bandpass range you want.
* The data can be spatially smoothed at runtime (so you don't have to keep smoothed versions of big datasets around).  This is quite fast, so no reason not to do it this way.
* rapidtide2 can generate a probe regressor from the global mean of the data itself - no externally recorded timecourse is required.  Optionally you can input both a mask of regions that you want to be included in the mean, and the voxels that you want excluded from the mean (there are situations when you might want to do one or the other or both).
* Determining the significance threshold for filtered correlations where the optimal delay has been selected is nontrivial; using the conventional formulae for the significance of a correlation leads to wildly inflated p values.  rapidtide2 estimates the spurious correlation threshold by calculating the distribution of null correlation values obtained with a shuffling  procedure at the beginning of each run (the default is to use 10000 shuffled correlations), and uses this value to mask the correlation maps it calculates.  As of version 0.1.2 it will also handle two-tailed significance, which you need when using bipolar mode.
* rapidtide2 can do an iterative refinement of the probe regressor by aligning the voxel timecourses in time and regenerating the test regressor.
* rapidtide2 fits the peak of the correlation function, so you can make fine grained distinctions between close lag times. The resolution of the time lag discrimination is set by the length of the timecourse, not the timestep – this is a feature of correlations, not rapidtide2.
* Once the time delay in each voxel has been found, rapidtide2 outputs a 4D file of delayed probe regressors for using as voxel specific confound regressors or to estimate the strength of the probe regressor in each voxel.  This regression is performed by default, but these outputs let you do it yourself if you are so inclined.
* I've put a lot of effort into making the outputs as informative as possible - lots of useful maps, histograms, timecourses, etc.
* There are a lot of tuning parameters you can mess with if you feel the need.  I've tried to make intelligent defaults so things will work well out of the box, but you have the ability to set most of the interesting parameters yourself.

Inputs:
"""""""

At a minimum, rapidtide2 needs a data file to work on (space by time), which is generally thought to be a BOLD fMRI data file.  This can be Nifti1 or Nifti2 (for fMRI data, in which case it is time by up to 3 spatial dimensions) or a whitespace separated text file (for NIRS data, each column is a time course, each row a separate channel); I can currently read (probably) but not write Cifti files, so if you want to use grayordinate files you need to convert them to nifti2 in workbench, run rapidtide2, then convert back. As soon as nibabel finishes their Cifti support (EDIT: and I get around to figuring it out), I'll add that.

The file needs one time dimension and at least one spatial dimension.  Internally, the array is flattened to a time by voxel array for simplicity.

The file you input here should be the result of any preprocessing you intend to do.  The expectation is that rapidtide will be run as the last preprocessing step before resting state or task based analysis.  So any slice time correction, motion correction, spike removal, etc. should already have been done.  If you use FSL, this means that if you've run preprocessing, you would use the filtered_func_data.nii.gz file as input.  Temporal and spatial filtering are the two (partial) exceptions here.  Generally rapidtide is most useful for looking at low frequency oscillations, so when you run it, you usually use the "-L" option or some other to limit the analysis to the detection and removal of low frequency systemic physiological oscillations.  So rapidtide will generally apply it's own temporal filtering on top of whatever you do in preprocessing.  Also, you have the option of doing spatial smoothing in rapidtide to boost the SNR of the analysis; the hemodynamic signals rapidtide looks for are often very smooth, so you rather than smooth your functional data excessively, you can do it within rapidtide so that only the hemodynamic data is smoothed at that level.

Outputs:
""""""""

Outputs are space or space by time Nifti or text files, depending on what the input data file was, and some text files containing textual information, histograms, or numbers.  Output spatial dimensions and file type match the input dimensions and file type (Nifti1 in, Nifti1 out).  Depending on the file type of map, there can be no time dimension, a time dimension that matches the input file, or something else, such as a time lag dimension for a correlation map.

	These options are somewhat self-explanatory.  I will be expanding this section of the manual going forward, but I want to put something here to get this out here.

#### Examples:
Rapidtide can do many things - as I've found more interesting things to do with time delay processing, it's gained new functions and options to support these new applications.  As a result, it can be a little hard to know what to use for a new experiment.  To help with that, I've decided to add this section to the manual to get you started.  It's broken up by type of data/analysis you might want to do.

##### Removing low frequency physiological noise from resting state data
This is what I thought most people would use rapidtide for - finding and removing the low frequency (LFO) signal from an existing dataset.  This presupposes you have not made a simultaneous physiological recording (well, you may have, but it assumes you aren't using it).  For this, you can use a minimal set of options, since the defaults are mostly right.

The base command you'd use would be:

	::

		rapidtide inputfmrifile outputname --frequencyband lfo --passes 3

This will do a fairly simple analysis.  First, the -L option means that rapidtide2 will prefilter the data to the LFO band (0.009-0.15Hz). It will then construct a regressor from the global mean of the signal in inputfmrifile (default behavior if no regressor is specified), and then use crosscorrelation to determine the time delay in each voxel.  The --refinepasses=3 option directs rapidtide to to perform the delay analysis 3 times, each time generating a new estimate of the global noise signal by aligning all of the timecourses in the data to bring the global signal in phase prior to averaging.  The --refineoffset flag recenters the peak of the delay distribution on zero during the refinement process, which should make datasets easier to compare.  After the three passes are complete, it will then use a GLM filter to remove a lagged copy of the final mean regressor that from the data - this denoised data will be in the file "outputname_filtereddata.nii.gz".  There will also a number of maps output with the prefix `"outputname_"` of delay, correlation strength and so on.

##### Mapping long time delays in response to a gas challenge experiment

Processing this sort of data requires a very different set of options from the previous case.  Instead of the distribution of delays you expect in healthy controls (a slightly skewed, somewhat normal distribution with a tail on the positive side, ranging from about -5 to 5 seconds), in this case, the maximum delay can be extremely long (100-120 seconds is not uncommon in stroke, moyamoya disesase, and atherosclerosis).  To do this, you need to radically change what options you use, not just the delay range, but a number of other options having to do with refinement and statistical measures.

For this type of analysis, a good place to start is the following:

	::

		rapidtide inputfmrifile outputname --numnull 0 --searchrange -10,30 --frequencyband lfo --ampthresh 0.2 --noglm --nofitfilt

The first option (-N 0), shuts off the calculation of the null correlation distribution.  This is used to determine the significance threshold, but the method currently implemented in rapidtide2 is a bit simplistic - it assumes that all the time points in the data are exchangable.  This is certainly true for resting state data (see above), but it is very much NOT true for block paradigm gas challenges.  To properly analyze those, I need to consider what time points are 'equivalent', and up to now, I don't, so setting the number of iterations in the Monte Carlo analysis to zero omits this step.

The second option (-r -10,140) is fairly obvious - this extends the detectable delay range out to 140 seconds.  Note that this is somewhat larger than the maximum delays we frequently see, but to find the correlation peak with maximum precision, you need sufficient additional delay values so that the correlation can come to a peak and then come down enough that you can properly fit it.

The -noglm option disables data filtering.  If you are using rapidtide to estimate and remove low frequency noise from resting state or task fMRI data, the last step is to use a glm filter to remove this circulatory signal, leaving "pure" neuronal activations, which you'll use in further analyses.  That's not relevant here - the signal you'd be removing is the one you care about. So this option skips that step to save time and disk space.

--nofitfilt skips a step after peak estimation.  Estimating the delay and correlation amplitude in each voxel is a two step process. First you make a quick estimate (where is the maximum point of the correlation function, and what is its amplitude?), then you refine it by fitting a Gaussian function to the peak to improve the estimate.  If this step fails, which it can if the peak is too close to the end of the lag range, or strangely shaped, the default behavior is to mark the point as bad and zero out the parameters for the voxel.  The nofitfilt option means that if the fit fails, output the initial estimates rather than all zeros.   This means that you get some information, even if it's not fully refined.  In my experience it does tend to make the maps for the gas challenge experiments a lot cleaner to use this option since the correlation function is pretty well behaved.


##### Denoising NIRS data (NEW)

When we started this whole research effort, I waw originally planning to denoise NIRS data, not fMRI data.  But one thing led to another, and the NIRS got derailed for the fMRI effort.  Now that we have some time to catch our breaths, and more importantly, we have access to some much higher quality NIRS data, this moved back to the front burner.  The majority of the work was already done, I just needed to account for a few qualities that make NIRS data different from fMRI data:

* NIRS data is not generally stored in NIFTI files.  There is not as yet a standard NIRS format.  In the absence of one, you could do worse than a multicolumn text file, with one column per data channel.  That's what I did here - if the file has a '.txt' extension rather than '.nii.', '.nii.gz', or no extension, it will assume all I/O should be done on multicolumn text files.
* NIRS data is often zero mean.  This turned out to mess with a lot of my assumptions about which voxels have significant data, and mask construction.  This has led to some new options for specifying mask threshholds and data averaging.
* NIRS data is in some sense "calibrated" as relative micromolar changes in oxy-, deoxy-, and total hemoglobin concentration, so mean and/or variance normalizing the timecourses may not be right thing to do.  I've added in some new options to mess with normalizations.



happy
----------

Description:
^^^^^^^^^^^^

	happy is a new addition to the rapidtide suite.  It's complementary to rapidtide - it's focussed on fast, cardiac signals in fMRI, rather than the slow, LFO signals we are usually looking at.  It's sort of a Frankenprogram - it has three distinct jobs, which are related, but are very distinct.

	The first thing happy does is try to extract a cardiac waveform from the fMRI data.  This is something I've been thinking about for a long time.  Words go here

	The second task is to take this raw estimate of the cardiac waveform, and clean it up using a deep learning filter.  The original signal is useful, but pretty gross, but I figured you should be able to exploit the pseudoperiodic nature of the signal to greatly improve it.  This is also a testbed to work on using neural nets to process time domain signals.  It seemed like a worthwhile project, so it got grafted in.

	The final task (which was actually the initial task, and the reason I wrote happy to begin with) is to implement Henning Voss' totally cool hypersampling with analytic phase projection (guess where the name "happy" comes from).  This is fairly straightforward, as Voss describes his method very clearly.  But I have lots of data with no simultaneously recorded cardiac signals, and I was too lazy to go find datasets with pleth data to play with, so that's why I did the cardiac waveform extraction part.


Inputs:
^^^^^^^
	Happy needs a 4D BOLD fMRI data file (space by time) as input.  This can be Nifti1 or Nifti2.  If you have a simultaneously recorded cardiac waveform, it will happily use it, otherwise it will try to construct (and refine) one. NOTE: the 4D input dataset needs to be completely unpreprocessed - gradient distortion correction and motion correction can destroy the relationship between slice number and actual acquisition time, and slice time correction does not behave as expected for aliased signals (which the cardiac component in fMRI most certainly is), and in any case we need the slice time offsets to construct our waveform.


Outputs:
^^^^^^^^
	Outputs are space or space by time Nifti or text files, depending on what the input data file was, and some text files containing textual information, histograms, or numbers.  Output spatial dimensions and file type match the input dimensions and file type (Nifti1 in, Nifti1 out).  Depending on the file type of map, there can be no time dimension, a time dimension that matches the input file, or something else, such as a time lag dimension for a correlation map.

The following files are produced, assuming XXX is the outputname:

	These options are somewhat self-explanatory.  I will be expanding this section of the manual going forward, but I want to put something here to get this out here.

Examples:
^^^^^^^^^

Just getting the cardiac waveform from resting state data
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The base command you'd use would be:

	::

		happy inputfmrifile slicetimefile outputroot --cardcalconly --dodlfilter

This won't get you the best cardiac waveform however.  You really should use a vessel mask to do the averaging only over "important" voxels.  Fortunately, you can get this from happy!  So a better way to do this is to run:

        ::

	        happy inputfmrifile slicetimefile firstpassoutput --dodlfilter
		happy inputfmrifile slicetimefile secondpassoutput --cardcalconly --dodlfilter --estmask=firstpassoutput_vesselmask.nii.gz

This uses the vessel mask produced by the first pass to limit the cardiac waveform calculation to vessel voxels in the second pass, giving a better initial cardiac estimate, which in turn gives a better filtered output.  The 25Hz plethysmogram will be found in secondpassoutput_cardfromfmri_dlfiletered_25.0Hz.txt


rapidtide2std
-------------

Description:
^^^^^^^^^^^^

	This is a utility for registering rapidtide output maps

	will only work if you have a working FSL installation.

Inputs:
^^^^^^^

Outputs:
^^^^^^^^

		    --linear           - only do linear transformation, even if warpfile exists


showxcorr
---------

Description:
^^^^^^^^^^^^

	Like rapidtide2, but for single time courses.  Takes two text files as input, calculates and displays
	the time lagged crosscorrelation between them, fits the maximum time lag, and estimates
	the significance of the correlation.  It has a range of filtering,
	windowing, and correlation options.

Inputs:
^^^^^^^
	showxcorr requires two text files containing timecourses with the same sample rate, one timepoint per line, which are to be correlated, and the sample rate.

showxcorrx
----------

Description:
^^^^^^^^^^^^

	This is the newest, most avant-garde version of showxcorr.  Because it's an x file, it's more fluid and I don't guarantee that it will keep a stable interface (or even work at any given time).  But every time I add something new, it goes here.  The goal is eventually to make this the "real" version.  Unlike rapidtide2, however, I've let it drift quite a bit without syncing it because some people here actually use showxcorr and I don't want to disrupt workflows...

Inputs:
^^^^^^^
	showxcorrx requires two text files containing timecourses with the same sample rate, one timepoint per line, which are to be correlated, and the sample rate.

Outputs:
^^^^^^^^
	showxcorrx  outputs everything to standard out, including the Pearson correlation, the maximum cross correlation, the time of maximum cross correlation, and estimates of the significance levels (if specified).  There are no output files.

pixelcomp
---------

Description:

	A program to compare voxel values in two 3D NIFTI files.
        You give pixelcomp two files, each with their own mask.

        and the value from the second file being y.  Pixelcomp then:
        1) Makes and displays a 2D histogram of all the xy values. 2) Does a linear
        fit to x and y, and outputs the coefficients (slope and offset)
        to a XXX_linfit.txt file. 3) Writes all the xy pairs to a tab
        separated text file, and 4) Makes a Bland-Altman plot of x vs y

OrthoImageItem.py
-----------------

Description:
^^^^^^^^^^^^
	This is a class that implements the orthographic projection module that is used to display all of the maps in tidepool. It uses pyqtgraph to do all the heavy lifting.
